# Web based Flight Simulators using Globe Earth

Exploring how it would look to fly a plane around a globe earth.

In the future I would like to explore how it would look to fly a plane around a flat earth as well to compare the two.

Currently the following are available:

- [CesiumJS Globe Flight Simulator](https://github.com/kristian-lange/flight-sims/tree/main/cesium-sim)
- [Three.js Globe Flight Simulator](https://github.com/kristian-lange/flight-sims/tree/main/threejs-sim)
- [React Three.js Globe Flight Simulator](https://github.com/kristian-lange/flight-sims/tree/main/react-sim)

## Setup

**Clone or Download:** Get the project files onto your local machine.

See Readme of the relevant sim project.
